# Code.org AP CSP Project Solutions

This repository contains solutions for Code.org AP Computer Science Principles ('21-'22) Projects (Unit 4 and Unit 5). There are two versions of each project. One with comments and one without comments. Some projects may include solutions using methods not learned in the Code.org AP CSP curriculum. These will be noted where applicable and will have alternate solutions provided. 

Solutions for Unit 7 Projects will come at a later point, and individual problems for any unit may be added if there is enough demand.
